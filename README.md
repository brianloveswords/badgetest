# badgetest

Badgetest is an unimaginatively named utility for issuing some number
of badges to some email address on the development, staging or production
server. 

You can choose to 

  * hash the email address, 
  * opt out of uniquifying the badge names (to test duplicate handling) 
  * and try out the modaless workflow, 

if you so choose.
